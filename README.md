# RPMD-Rate-Theory
This repository uses RPMD + Bennet-Chandler to calculate the reaction rate constants for scattering over symmetric and asymmetric Eckart barrier.

It aims to replicate the results of this paper:
Ian R. Craig, David E. Manolopoulos; A refined ring polymer molecular dynamics theory of chemical reaction rates. J. Chem. Phys. 15 July 2005; 123 (3): 034102. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1954769

The theory are explained there in detail.
