# RPMD-Rate-Theory
This repository uses RPMD + Bennet-Chandler to calculate the reaction rate constants for scattering over symmetric and asymmetric Eckart barrier.

It aims to replicate the results of this paper:
Ian R. Craig, David E. Manolopoulos; A refined ring polymer molecular dynamics theory of chemical reaction rates. J. Chem. Phys. 15 July 2005; 123 (3): 034102. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1954769

The theory are explained there in detail.

I used small sample sizes and long time steps due to the limited computing power of my laptop, but the results should already be sufficiently converged and close to the literature values.
